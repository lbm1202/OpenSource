제안 배경 : 조원 3명 모두 딥러닝에 관심이 있었고, 공부와 병행하여 간단한 image classification model을 구현에 도전해 보기로 하였다.     

system function : Implementation of image classification neural network through basic deep learning model.
                  The dataset is still undecided.     

Development Schedule
  *week1(05/10~5/17)
  : Reference research & individual study for basic deep learning     
        
  *week2,3(05/18~05/31)
  : Implementation study through github(AlexNet)     
        
  *week 4(06/1~06/8)
  : Other Model or real time object detection      
        
  *remain week
  : model training week & presentation preparation    
      
Distributing Roles
  *Because it is a basic model implementation, everyone participates in study, development, and presentation
